This is a fork of easy-globalize2-accessors, but it is compatible with rails3/globalize3, is a gem and has few great advantages...

1- The method does not take any variables yet, it will pick up all available locales and all translatable fields and add translation methoids to them (i.e name_fr, name_en , description_fr_CA, description_en_US)

2-it is a gem and compatible with Rails3 and Globalize3


Prerequisites :

-	Globalize3
-	Rails3
- ruby 1.9.2 (not tested with earlier version)


TODO:

- add more customization
- do more testing
- add test scripts

Please consider that the code is not yet published and may contain bugs... then take the code as is.

If you see any bugs, things that can embellish the gem and make it complete or anything , please let me know.

cheers
